# ngConf Tweets

This project was hacked together during ngConf 2016 using Angular CLI and Angular 2.

# How to run

Set a few environment variables for Twitter API access:

```
export CONSUMER_KEY='xxxxx'
export CONSUMER_SECRET='xxxx'
export ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY='xxxx'
export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='xxxx'
```
Get the repo set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/Trendy/ngconf-tweets.git
npm install -g angular-cli
npm install
npm run start-server
# Visit http://localhost:8000 for the profit
